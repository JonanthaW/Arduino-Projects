Arduino is an open source physical computing platform based on simple I/O
board and a development environment that implements the Processing/Wiring
tongue. Arduino can be used to develop standalone interactive objects or
can be connected to software on your computer (eg Flash, Processing and MaxMSP).
The plates can be assembled manually or purchased pre-assembled; the open source
IDE can be downloaded for free from [https://arduino.cc](https://www.arduino.cc/en/Main/Software).
